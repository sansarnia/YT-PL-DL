you can download the `MusicdlGUI.zip` from the Releases, unzip it and the run the .exe file inside.
*Note that the playlist you want to download must be public.

### Note to self
for the ffmpeg.exe : 
download the latest prebuilt Windows binaries here:  
ðŸ‘‰ [https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/)

Look for the file named:

Download `ffmpeg-git-full.7z`

When you extract it, youâ€™ll see something like:

ffmpeg-2025-08-20-git-...
    
    â””â”€bin\
     â”œâ”€ ffmpeg.exe
     â”œâ”€ ffplay.exe
     â””â”€ ffprobe.exe

The file you need is `bin/ffmpeg.exe`.
Just copy that `ffmpeg.exe` into the same folder as the Python script `MusicdlGUI.py`.


command for .exe build : 
$ pyinstaller --clean -y MusicdlGUI.spec
